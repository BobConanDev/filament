# Web Tutorials

The markdown source for these tutorials are not only used to generate this book;
they're also used to generate the JavaScript for the above demo. We use a small
Python script for weaving (generating HTML) and tangling (generating JS). In the
code samples, you'll often see `// TODO: <some task>`. These are special markers
that get replaced by subsequent code blocks.
